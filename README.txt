This project contains 6 functions for image processing

Features:

-imageSave and imageLoad are simply for saving and loading to help with using the other functions
-imageDisplay lets the user choose between displaying an image spatially (2 dimensionally) or as a graph 
of frequency (the change in pixel intensity across an image)
-pixelSegment: outputs a black and white version of the original image separated into the foreground (black) and background (white)
-colouriser: converts a grayscale image into colour based on a variety of colourmaps
edgeDetector: outputs a black and white version of the original where the edges of all objects are outlined. Can be customised for sensitivity to edges

Requirements:
